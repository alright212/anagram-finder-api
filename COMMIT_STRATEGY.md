# Estonian Anagram Finder API - Commit Strategy

This document outlines the detailed commit strategy used to develop the Estonian Anagram Finder API.

## Strategy Overview

The development of this API followed a carefully planned 13-commit strategy, designed to:

1. Create a logical progression of features
2. Maintain a clean, readable commit history
3. Support incremental review and testing
4. Provide clear documentation of the development process

## Commit Structure

Each commit in this project follows a structured format:

```
<type>: <short summary>

<detailed description with bullet points>
```

Where `<type>` is one of:
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
